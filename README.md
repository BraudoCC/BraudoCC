### Welcome to my (Chaochuan Hou, ‰æØÊúùÂ∑ù for Chinese) profile:
I am a fourth-year PhD student (a 5-year program) at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I work with my supervisors, [Songqiao Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C73EXPMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Hailiang Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kCtylwwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), as well as my senior fellow, [Minqi Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OBdS69UAAAAJ&hl=en) in [SUFE AI Lab](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nFlYaUn0o73iz5nLM73qBg). My research focuses on anomaly detection and time series analysis, including time series anomaly detection, time series forecasting, LLM for time series, and time series foundational models.
